The TABS API enables devs to create agents to automate web interactions, like clicking, scrolling, searching, and submitting forms \"just like a human\". Real-time feedback and adaptive behaviours will, Mozilla say, offer \"full control of the web, without the complexity.\" \n\n\n\n\nAs TABS is not powered by a Mozilla-backed LLM you'll need to connect it to your choice of third-party LLM for any relevant processing... Developers get 1,000 requests monthly on the free tier, which seems reasonable for prototyping personal projects. Complex agentic workloads may require more.

To find otherwise would defy the power of Congress to confer upon agencies the authority to grant funding in the first place,” the judge stated.\n\nOrrick also noted that the plaintiffs’ interests in obtaining the funding to support critical infrastructure and emergency response programs for their communities far outweigh the administration’s interests.\n\n“As indicated above, plaintiffs represent over thirty million individuals, and their DHS and FEMA grants provide funding to support these disaster and public safety initiatives. Many of the plaintiffs would be unable to otherwise fund these programs without grants,” the judge said.\n\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Diego were among the plaintiffs that filed https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.457203/gov.uscourts.cand.457203.1.0.pdf\n on Sept. 30 to prevent the administration from imposing what they called “unlawful conditions” on more than $350 million in emergency and disaster preparedness funds.\n\nIn a joint https://news.santaclaracounty.gov/federal-court-halts-trump-administrations-attack-disaster-preparedness-funding\n, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu welcomed the ruling, saying that withholding emergency and disaster preparedness funds would put public safety at risk.\n\n“This funding means faster emergency response times, stronger regional coordination, and better protection for our residents during disasters and terrorist attacks,” Chiu stated. “We appreciate the Court ruled in our favor and blocked this unlawful overreach.”\n\nSanta Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti, part of the plaintiffs, praised the judge for recognizing that the administration’s “political agenda” should not influence the funding.\n\n“As local governments, we take our responsibility seriously to protect all members of the community from the ravages of disaster, no matter their politics,” LoPresti said in the statement. “Governments shouldn’t have to pass a political litmus test to be able to care for their communities, especially in the face of a disaster.”\n\nDHS and FEMA did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.\n\n      https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\n\nSun, 11/23/2025 - 15:10\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-blocks-trump-admin-placing-conditions-federal-disaster-funds","tags":[["proxy","https://cms.zerohedge.com/fullrss2.xml#https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fpolitical%2Fjudge-blocks-trump-admin-placing-conditions-federal-disaster-funds","rss"]],"created_at":1763928600}}

The TABS API enables devs to create agents to automate web interactions, like clicking, scrolling, searching, and submitting forms \"just like a human\". Real-time feedback and adaptive behaviours will, Mozilla say, offer \"full control of the web, without the complexity.\" \n\n\n\n\nAs TABS is not powered by a Mozilla-backed LLM you'll need to connect it to your choice of third-party LLM for any relevant processing... Developers get 1,000 requests monthly on the free tier, which seems reasonable for prototyping personal projects. Complex agentic workloads may require more. Though pricing is yet to be locked in, the TABS API website suggests it'll cost ~$5 per 1000 requests.\nPaid plans will offer additional features too, like lower latency and, somewhat ironically, CAPTCHA solving so AI can 'prove' it's not a robot on pages gated to prevent automated activities. \n\n\n\nGoogle, OpenAI, and other major AI vendors offer their own agentic APIs. Mozilla is pitching up late, but it plans to play differently. It touts a \"strong focus on data minimisation and security\", with scraped data treated ephemerally — i.e., not kept. As a distinction, that matters. AI agents can be given complex online tasks that involve all sorts of personal or sensitive data being fetched and worked with.... If you're minded to make one, perhaps without a motivation to asset-strip the common good, Mozilla's TABS API look like a solid place to start.\n\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Mozilla+Announces+'TABS+API'+For+Developers+Building+AI+Agents%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F11%2F23%2F206245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F11%2F23%2F206245%2Fmozilla-announces-tabs-api-for-developers-building-ai-agents%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\nhttps://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/206245/mozilla-announces-tabs-api-for-developers-building-ai-agents?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&utm_medium=feed\n at Slashdot.\n\nhttps://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/206245/mozilla-announces-tabs-api-for-developers-building-ai-agents?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","tags":[["t","mozilla"],["proxy","http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot#https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F11%2F23%2F206245%2Fmozilla-announces-tabs-api-for-developers-building-ai-agents%3Futm_source%3Drss1.0mainlinkanon%26utm_medium%3Dfeed","rss"]],"created_at":1763928540}}

To find otherwise would defy the power of Congress to confer upon agencies the authority to grant funding in the first place,” the judge stated.\n\nOrrick also noted that the plaintiffs’ interests in obtaining the funding to support critical infrastructure and emergency response programs for their communities far outweigh the administration’s interests.\n\n“As indicated above, plaintiffs represent over thirty million individuals, and their DHS and FEMA grants provide funding to support these disaster and public safety initiatives. Many of the plaintiffs would be unable to otherwise fund these programs without grants,” the judge said.\n\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Diego were among the plaintiffs that filed https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.457203/gov.uscourts.cand.457203.1.0.pdf\n on Sept. 30 to prevent the administration from imposing what they called “unlawful conditions” on more than $350 million in emergency and disaster preparedness funds.\n\nIn a joint https://news.santaclaracounty.gov/federal-court-halts-trump-administrations-attack-disaster-preparedness-funding\n, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu welcomed the ruling, saying that withholding emergency and disaster preparedness funds would put public safety at risk.\n\n“This funding means faster emergency response times, stronger regional coordination, and better protection for our residents during disasters and terrorist attacks,” Chiu stated. “We appreciate the Court ruled in our favor and blocked this unlawful overreach.”\n\nSanta Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti, part of the plaintiffs, praised the judge for recognizing that the administration’s “political agenda” should not influence the funding.\n\n“As local governments, we take our responsibility seriously to protect all members of the community from the ravages of disaster, no matter their politics,” LoPresti said in the statement. “Governments shouldn’t have to pass a political litmus test to be able to care for their communities, especially in the face of a disaster.”\n\nDHS and FEMA did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.\n\n      https://cms.zerohedge.com/users/tyler-durden\n\nSun, 11/23/2025 - 15:10\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/judge-blocks-trump-admin-placing-conditions-federal-disaster-funds","tags":[["proxy","https://cms.zerohedge.com/fullrss2.xml#https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zerohedge.com%2Fpolitical%2Fjudge-blocks-trump-admin-placing-conditions-federal-disaster-funds","rss"]],"created_at":1763928600}}
